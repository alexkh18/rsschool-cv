## About:
I want to start career of developer and want to become a good specialist to be able to work on interesting projects and create something really cool. Or share your knowledge, what is interesting too.

I'm an engineer by education, and I always liked to create, to learn something new, especially, if that can help me to implement new or improve old things.

I'm a responsible worker. I always try to have good understanding of all what i do and try to do as well as possible (as far as my skills allow). And I think what this is a good characteristics, but sometimes this may be not very good.
